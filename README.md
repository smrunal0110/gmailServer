# gmailServer
to compile: g++ main.cpp gmail_server.cpp -l sqlite3 -lgcrypt sha256.cpp
to run: ./a.out
I have provided sample ouputrun in ouputrun.txt
I have provided qa report in qareport.txt to see if there are any vulnerabilities.
I used cppcheck and the results are pretty good
I was not able to run rosecheckers since connection to sei seems down
